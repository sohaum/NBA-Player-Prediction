# NBA Player Career Duration Prediction with Naive Bayes

## Introduction
This project builds a Naive Bayes model to predict the career longevity of NBA players, focusing on whether they remain in the league for at least five years. The model uses rookie-year performance data and feature-engineered insights to make predictions.

## Dataset
- **Observations**: 1,341 players
- **Features**: Rookie-year stats and engineered features
- **Target**: Boolean value indicating a career duration of five years or more

## Objective
Create a model that assists NBA management by identifying players with high long-term potential. This tool can inform decisions on training, scouting, and player retention.

## Model Overview
Naive Bayes is chosen for its ability to handle new, evolving data. By analyzing performance from rookie years, it offers a quick and adaptable approach to predicting player longevity.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Extracted NBA player performance records.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Optimized features based on prior analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Implemented Naive Bayes for binary classification on career duration.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy and performance with test data.
